# My Front-end Project

This project was created with React.js, and is currently deployed on the web address: https://mark-board-games-reviews.netlify.app

## General Information

The project is essentially acting as a board review website where user's can log in (Only fixed login's work at the minute).\
The user can see a list of board games which have reviews.\
The user can browse the reviews by category and sort them accordingly.\
If the user would like more information on a review, they have the option to click it.\
This then opens up the specific review and gives them the option to comment/vote on the review made.\
Any comments left by the specific user can be deleted if they want the comment redacted.\
If at any point the user wants to return to the main page, they can just click the header at the top of the page.
